Use the available Omnigrex MCP tools to read the Issue and relevant collaboration state before making changes.
Do not access GitHub directly through network clients or credentials; use Omnigrex MCP tools for all GitHub reads and mutations.
Implement the smallest complete solution, follow the repository instructions, and run appropriate local verification.
When the Change Proposal is ready, publish the changes, open or update the Pull Request, and request Reviewer evaluation through the Omnigrex MCP tools.
If you cannot proceed safely, report the blocker through the Omnigrex MCP tools instead of guessing.
